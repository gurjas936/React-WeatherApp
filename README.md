# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Weather Application with React
- It can ask for location permission from the user, and if the user does not want to do that, it will show weather at the dummy coordinates, and after that, the user can search for the desired city around the world.
- The weather data is received through API calls, and I have used the openweather API for that.
- I have also shared the screenshots above.
